Here’s a step-by-step process to create a Snake Game in JavaScript without using the canvas:

Step 1: Setup the Game Board
Create a grid layout using HTML elements (e.g., div tags) to represent the game board.
Define the size of the grid, for example, 20x20 cells.
Style the grid using CSS to give it a uniform look.

---------------------------------------------------
Step 3: Snake Movement
Use setInterval or requestAnimationFrame to move the snake continuously.
Update the snake's position based on the current direction (up, down, left, or right).
Keep track of the snake's current direction using key presses (event listeners).
Step 4: Snake Growth
When the snake eats the food (i.e., the head of the snake reaches the food’s position), increase the size of the snake by adding a new segment to the tail.
After eating food, generate a new food item at a random position.
Step 5: Collision Detection
Check if the snake hits the walls (grid boundaries) or itself (head touching any other part of the body). If a collision is detected, the game is over.
Step 6: Game Over and Restart
When a collision happens, show a "Game Over" message and provide a button or option to restart the game.
Reset the snake, food, and game state.
Step 7: Scoring System
Keep track of the score based on how many food items the snake eats.
Display the score on the screen and update it dynamically.
Step 8: Styling the Game
Style the snake, food, and grid using CSS to make the game visually appealing.
Use colors or simple animations for the snake and food to improve the user experience.
This process covers the core logic to build the game without using the canvas.
